# WCTC_EFTutorial_Blogs

This program is a practical implementation of the Entity Framework Core tutorial available at [Microsoft Learn - EF Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/overview/first-app).  It's a great resource for getting started with Entity Framework Core.

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a lightweight, extensible, open-source, and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology. EF Core can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), enabling .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects, and eliminating the need for most of the data-access code they usually need to write.

In this program, we are creating a simple blog system. The user can create new posts, read existing ones, update their details, and delete them if needed. All these operations are performed using EF Core, which handles the communication with the database.

Please follow the tutorial closely to understand the concepts and how to implement them in your own projects.
